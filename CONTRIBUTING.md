# Contributing to DPG

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document covers everything you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Go 1.25 or later | `go version` to verify |
| GCC or Clang | Required for CGo — `pg_query_go` links against the PostgreSQL C parser |
| `staticcheck` | Optional, for `make lint` — `go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest` |

No live PostgreSQL instance is required for most development. The test suite is fully offline.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dullkingsman/dpg
cd dpg
make build     # builds core/build/dpg
make test      # runs all tests
```

## Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Write tests** for any new behaviour. Most packages have `_test.go` files alongside the source. The `examples/` directory contains end-to-end pipeline tests — add a fixture if you are changing compilation or diffing behaviour.

3. **Run the full suite** before pushing:
   ```bash
   make test
   make vet
   ```

4. **Commit messages** should be concise and written in the imperative mood (`add support for X`, `fix Y when Z`). Reference issues where applicable (`fixes #42`).

5. **Open a pull request** against `main` with a clear description of what changed and why. Include the relevant section of the [RFC](rfc/dpg-1.md) if your change affects language semantics.

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`).
- Avoid comments that restate what the code does. Prefer comments that explain *why* — hidden constraints, non-obvious invariants, workarounds.
- Do not add error handling for scenarios that cannot happen. Trust framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs).
- Keep new abstractions close to the call site until a clear need for reuse emerges.

## Running the Linter

```bash
make lint      # requires staticcheck on PATH
```

## Reporting Bugs

Open a GitHub issue with:
- DPG version (`dpg --version`)
- A minimal `.dpg` source file or snapshot that reproduces the issue
- The command you ran, the output you got, and the output you expected

## Proposing Features

Open an issue before writing significant code. Features that change language semantics should reference or propose an RFC amendment. The current specification lives in [rfc/dpg-1.md](rfc/dpg-1.md).
