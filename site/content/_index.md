description: "A declarative, state-based superset of PostgreSQL SQL that compiles to idiomatic PG DDL."

## What is DPG?

DPG is a schema compiler and migration tool for PostgreSQL. You describe what your database **should be**; DPG figures out what needs to change and generates the minimal, safe SQL migration.

```sql
TABLE users (
    id   BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL
) {
    INDICES { users_email_idx UNIQUE (email); }
    GRANTS { SELECT, INSERT TO app_role; }
}
```

Run `dpg plan` to see the SQL diff. Run `dpg apply` to execute it.

## Key Features

- **Offline-first** — `dpg plan` and `dpg diff` never require a live database
- **Safe by default** — destructive operations are blocked unless explicitly permitted
- **Snapshot-driven** — the committed snapshot is the source of truth, not the live DB
- **Zero new syntax** — DPG extends valid PostgreSQL DDL; no new language to learn
- **Plugin API** — extend the pipeline via `pkg/dpg` (linters, snapshot stores, apply executors)
