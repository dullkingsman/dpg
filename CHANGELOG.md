# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pkg/dpg` — stable public API package: re-exports all IR types, `Compile`, `Lint`, and `Discover` for external consumers (language servers, editor plugins, CI integrations)
- `dpg fmt` — comment-preserving formatter for `.dpg` source files: rewrites keyword case, normalises blank lines, and reconstructs declarations from the IR-derived parse tree
  - `--check` flag: exits 1 if any file would change (CI gate, no files written)
  - `--diff` flag: prints a unified diff of what would change (no files written)
  - Configurable via `[fmt]` section in `dpg.toml`: `indent` (spaces per level) and `keyword_case` ("upper" / "lower")
- `internal/scanutil` — shared byte-level scanning primitives (`SkipSingleQuoted`, `PeekDollarTag`, `SkipDollarQuoted`, `SkipLineComment`, `SkipBlockComment`) used by the format lexer
- `internal/format` — standalone formatting pipeline: token-level lexer → FormatAST (with comment attachment) → canonical renderer

### Fixed

- Differ: `createOpaque` now returns an error when a pass-through object body was not captured, instead of silently emitting a SQL comment that would have been a no-op on apply

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-29

Initial release.

### Added

**CLI**
- `dpg plan` — diff source files against the committed snapshot and print the minimal SQL migration; supports `--live` to diff against a live database instead
- `dpg apply` — lint, diff, prompt for approval, execute the SQL migration, and update the committed snapshot; supports `--allow-destructive` and `--yes`
- `dpg verify` — connect to a live database and report any drift from the committed snapshot
- `dpg dump` — introspect a live database and generate initial `.dpg` source files and an initial snapshot
- `dpg diff` — diff two `.dpg` source directories and print the SQL between them (no database required)
- `dpg portability` — report PostgreSQL-specific constructs in use and suggest standard SQL alternatives
- `--cluster` and `--database` flags on all commands for multi-cluster/multi-database projects
- Cluster-level objects (roles) planned, applied, and snapshotted independently from databases

**Compiler**
- Source file scanning, parsing via `pg_query_go`, and IR construction for all supported object types
- Schema context inference from directory layout
- Dependency-ordered compilation with topological sort and `DEFERRABLE` cycle handling for circular foreign keys

**Object support**
- Tables: columns (including `IDENTITY`, `GENERATED`, computed), inline single-column constraints, table-level constraints, indexes, RLS, comments, grants
- Views and materialized views
- Functions and procedures
- Types: `ENUM`, `DOMAIN`, composite
- Sequences (user-defined; identity-owned sequences are filtered)
- Roles
- Extensions
- Schemas

**Differ**
- `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` generation for all supported object types
- Safety classification: every generated statement tagged `SAFE`, `CAUTION`, `DESTRUCTIVE`, or `MANUAL`
- Destructive operations blocked by default; require `--allow-destructive`
- Warning on `dpg apply` for new tables created without a primary key

**Snapshot**
- JSON snapshot format committed alongside source files
- `dpg dump` rebuilds the snapshot from compiled source to ensure the first `dpg plan` after a dump produces no diff

**Linter**
- Configurable static analysis: deprecated column detection, hardcoded password detection, missing column comments
- Lint diagnostics printed to stderr before any migration is emitted

**Emit**
- Transactional wrapper (`BEGIN` / `COMMIT`) for all safe operations
- Non-transactional post-commit block for `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` and similar
- Safety labels and source position annotations in rendered output
- ANSI colour support

**Portability analysis**
- Detection and reporting of PostgreSQL-specific constructs with standard SQL alternatives

**Project structure**
- `dpg.toml` discovery with cluster and database directory layout
- Secret resolution via `env:` and `link:` URI schemes
- Migration archiving to a configurable directory
